# kotlin-anki-cards

**This Kotlin ANKI deck dedicated to language reference from official http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/ site.**  

Currently contains **317** notes(cards) inside.

This deck covers almost all info from official docs except JS, Tooling and some FAQ sections.  
Experimental features (like 'coroutines' in Kotlin 1.1) won't be added as well.  
I won't add JS-related sections in future.
